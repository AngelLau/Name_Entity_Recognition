# Name_Entity_Recognition
### Used NLTK's in-built functions to accept sentences and output the corresponding named-entity tags in the IOB2 format.
### Trained a neural net architecture to predict the named entity. Applied word embed-dings to vectorize words in sentences. Used a Bidirectional LSTM layer to read sequence input. Increased the accuracy of recognition to 94.15%
